                    <p>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies: Channel Response Bot and our third-party partners, such as

                    different Services and devices. For more information, please see our Cookie Policy, which includes
                        information on how to control or opt out of these cookies and tracking technologies.</p>


                    <h2>Information we receive from other sources</h2>

                    <p>We receive information about you from other Service users, from third-party services, from our
                        related companies, and from our business and channel partners.</p>


                    <p>Information through hosting Platforms: We provide services that reside inside and consume data from
                    other online platforms (such as Slack or Microsoft Teams, collectively referred to as "Platforms").
                    When adding the relevant Services to the Platforms, we request permissions which allow sharing of
                    information such as account and profile information or settings of the relevant Platform. For a list
                    of currently supported platforms and links to their respective policies and help documents, see the
                    Platform Information page.</p>


                    <p>Other users of the Services: Other users of our Services may provide information about you when they
                    submit content through the Services. For example, you may be mentioned in a Channel Response Bot
                    poll created by someone else. Similarly, an administrator may provide your user name when they
                        designate you as the billing or technical contact on your company's account.</p>


                    <p>Other services you link to your account: We receive information about you when you or your
                    administrator integrate or link a third-party service with our Services. For example, if you create
                    an account or log into the Services using your Google credentials, we receive your name and email
                    address as permitted by your Google profile settings in order to authenticate you. You or your
                    administrator may also integrate our Services with other services you use, such as to allow you to
                    access, store, share and edit certain content from a third-party through our Services. For example,
                    you may authorize our Services to access, display and store files from a third-party
                    document-sharing service within the Services interface. Or you may authorize our Services to connect
                    with a third-party calendaring service so that your meetings and connections are available to you
                    through the Services. You may authorize our Services to sync a contact list or address book so that
                    you can easily connect with those contacts within the Services or invite them to collaborate with
                    you on our Services. The information we receive when you link or integrate our Services with a
                    third-party service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy policy controlled by that
                    third-party service. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party
                        services to understand what data may be disclosed to us or shared with our Services.</p>


                    <p>Channel Response Bot Partners: We work with partners who provide consulting, implementation,
                    training and other services around our products. Some of these partners also help us to market and
                    promote our products, generate leads for us, and resell our products. We receive information from
                    these partners, such as billing information, billing and technical contact information, company
                    name, what Channel Response Bot products you have purchased or may be interested in, evaluation
                        information you have provided, what events you have attended, and what country you are in.</p>


                    <p>Other Partners: We receive information about you and your activities on and off the Services from
                    third-party partners, such as advertising and market research partners who provide us with
                        information about your interest in and engagement with, our Services and online advertisements.</p>


                    <p>How we use information we collect
                    How we use the information we collect depends in part on which Services you use, how you use them,
                    and any preferences you have communicated to us. Below are the specific purposes for which we use
                        the information we collect about you.</p>


                    <p>To provide the Services and personalize your experience: We use information about you to provide the
                    Services to you, including to process transactions with you, authenticate you when you log in,
                    provide customer support, and operate and maintain the Services. For example, we use the name and
                    picture you provide in your account to identify you to other Service users. Our Services also
                    include tailored features that personalize your experience, enhance your productivity, and improve
                    your ability to collaborate effectively with others by automatically analyzing the activities of
                    your team to provide search results, activity feeds, notifications, connections and recommendations
                    that are most relevant for you and your team. For example, we may use your stated job title and
                    activity to return search results we think are relevant to your job function. We also use
                    information about you to connect you with other team members seeking your subject matter expertise.
                    We may use your email domain to infer your affiliation with a particular organization or industry to
                        personalize the content and experience you receive on our websites.</p>


                    <p>For research and development: We are always looking for ways to make our Services smarter, faster,
                    secure, integrated, and useful to you. We use collective learnings about how people use our Services
                    and feedback provided directly to us to troubleshoot and to identify trends, usage, activity
                    patterns and areas for integration and improvement of the Services. For example, to improve the
                    audience select feature, we may automatically analyze recent interactions among users and how often
                    they select certain audience. We automatically analyze and aggregate frequently used search terms to
                    improve the accuracy and relevance of suggested topics that auto-populate when you create new
                    content. In some cases, we apply these learnings across our Services to improve and develop similar
                    features or to better integrate the services you use. We also test and analyze certain new features
                        with some users before rolling the feature out to all users. </p>


                    <p>To communicate with you about the Services: We use your contact information to send transactional
                    communications via email and within the Services, including confirming your purchases, reminding you
                    of subscription expirations, responding to your comments, questions and requests, providing customer
                    support, and sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages.
                    We also send you communications as you onboard to a particular Service to help you become more
                    proficient in using that Service. These communications are part of the Services and in most cases
                    you cannot opt out of them. If an opt out is available, you will find that option within the
                        communication itself or in your account settings.</p>


                    <p>To market, promote and drive engagement with the Services: We use your contact information and
                    information about how you use the Services to send promotional communications that may be of
                    specific interest to you, including by email and by displaying Channel Response Bot ads on other
                    companies' websites and applications, as well as on platforms like Facebook and Google. These
                    communications are aimed at driving engagement and maximizing what you get out of the Services,
                    including information about new features, survey requests, newsletters, and events we think may be
                    of interest to you. We also communicate with you about new product offers, promotions and contests.
                    You can control whether you receive these communications as described below under "Opt-out of
                        communications."</p>


                    <p>Customer support: We use your information to resolve technical issues you encounter, to respond to
                        your requests for assistance, to analyze crash information, and to repair and improve the Services.</p>


                    <p>For safety and security: We use information about you and your Service use to verify accounts and
                    activity, to monitor suspicious or fraudulent activity and to identify violations of Service
                        policies.</p>


                    <p>To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights: Where required by law or where we
                    believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, we use
                    information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions,
                        and disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business.</p>

                    <p>With your consent: We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a
                    specific purpose not listed above. For example, we may publish testimonials or featured customer
                        stories to promote the Services, with your permission.</p>


                    <h2>How we share information we collect</h2>

                    <p>We make collaborative tools, and we want them to work well for you. This means sharing information
                    through the Services and with certain third parties. We share information we collect about you in
                    the ways discussed below, including in connection with possible business transfers, but we are not
                        in the business of selling information about you to advertisers or other third parties.</p>


                    <h2>Sharing with other Service users</h2>

                    <p>When you use the Services, we share certain information about you with other Service users.</p>


                    <p>For collaboration: You can create content, which may contain information about you, and grant
                    permission to others to see, share, edit, copy and download that content based on settings you or
                    your administrator (if applicable) select. Some of the collaboration features of the Services
                    display some or all of your profile information to other Service users when you share or interact
                    with specific content. For example, when you comment on a Channel Response Bot poll, we may display
                    your profile picture and name next to your comments so that other users with access to the page or
                        issue understand who made the comment.</p>


                    <p>Managed accounts and administrators: If you register or access the Services using an email address
                    with a domain that is owned by your employer or organization, and such organization wishes to
                    establish an account or site, certain information about you including your name, profile picture,
                    contact info, content and past use of your account may become accessible to that organization’s
                    administrator and other Service users sharing the same domain. If you are an administrator for a
                    particular site or group of users within the Services, we may share your contact information with
                        current or past Service users, for the purpose of facilitating Service-related requests.</p>


                    <p>Community Forums: Our websites offer publicly accessible blogs, forums, and issue trackers. You
                    should be aware that any information you provide on these websites - including profile information
                    associated with the account you use to post the information - may be read, collected, and used by
                    any member of the public who accesses these websites. Your posts and certain profile information may
                    remain even after you terminate your account. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any
                    information you input into these Services. To request removal of your information from publicly
                    accessible websites operated by us, please contact us as provided below. In some cases, we may not
                        be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to and why.</p>


                    <h2>Sharing with third parties</h2>

                    <p>We share information with third parties that help us operate, provide, improve, integrate,
                        customize, support and market our Services.</p>

                    <p>Service Providers: We work with third-party service providers to provide website and application
                    development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing,
                    analysis and other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you.
                    If a service provider needs to access information about you to perform services on our behalf, they
                    do so under close instruction from us, including policies and procedures designed to protect your
                    information. </p>


                    <p>Channel Response Bot Partners: We work with third parties who provide consulting, sales, and
                    technical services to deliver and implement customer solutions around the Services. We may share
                    your information with these third parties in connection with their services, such as to assist with
                    billing and collections, to provide localized support, and to provide customizations. We may also
                        share information with these third parties where you have agreed to that sharing.</p>


                    <p>Third Party Apps: You, your administrator or other Service users may choose to add new functionality
                    or change the behavior of the Services by installing third party apps (like Google Calendar) within
                    the Services. Doing so may give third-party apps access to your account and information about you
                    like your name and email address, and any content you choose to use in connection with those apps.
                    Third-party app policies and procedures are not controlled by us, and this privacy policy does not
                    cover how third-party apps use your information. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of
                    third parties before connecting to or using their applications or services to learn more about their
                    privacy and information handling practices. If you object to information about you being shared with
                        these third parties, please uninstall the app.</p>


                    <p>Links to Third Party Sites: The Services may include links that direct you to other websites or
                    services whose privacy practices may differ from ours. If you submit information to any of those
                    third party sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies, not this one. We
                        encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.</p>


                    <p>Social Media Widgets: The Services may include links that direct you to other websites or services
                    whose privacy practices may differ from ours. Your use of and any information you submit to any of
                        those third-party sites is governed by their privacy policies, not this one.</p>


                    <p>Third-Party Widgets: Some of our Services contain widgets and social media features, such as the
                    Twitter "tweet" button. These widgets and features collect your IP address, which page you are
                    visiting on the Services, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Widgets
                    and social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Services.
                    Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing
                        it.</p>


                    <p>With your consent: We share information about you with third parties when you give us consent to do
                    so. For example, we often display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our public
                        websites. With your consent, we may post your name alongside the testimonial.</p>


                    <p>Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws; Enforcement of Our Rights: In exceptional
                    circumstances, we may share information about you with a third party if we believe that sharing is
                    reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or
                    governmental request, including to meet national security requirements, (b) enforce our agreements,
                    policies and terms of service, (c) protect the security or integrity of our products and services,
                    (d) protect Channel Response Bot, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or
                    (e) respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to
                        assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person.</p>


                    <p>Business Transfers: We may share or transfer information we collect under this privacy policy in
                    connection with any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of
                        our business to another company.</p>


                    <h2>How we store and secure information we collect</h2>


                    <h3>Information storage and security</h3>

                    <p>We use data hosting service providers in the United States to host the information we collect, and
                        we use technical measures to secure your data.</p>


                    <p>While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is
                    impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, during
                    transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is
                    absolutely safe from intrusion by others. For more details, see the Security page.</p>


                    <h3>How long we keep information</h3>

                    <p>How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described
                    in further detail below. After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if
                    this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then
                    we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is
                        possible.</p>


                    <p>Account information: We retain your account information for as long as your account is active and a
                    reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services. We also retain some of
                    your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce
                    our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services.
                    Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate
                    information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective
                    insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about
                        you.</p>


                    <p>Information you share on the Services: If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your
                    information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow your team members or
                    other users to make full use of the Services. For example, we continue to display votes you sent to
                        the users that received them and continue to display content you provided.</p>


                    <p>Managed accounts: If the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g., your
                    employer), we retain your information as long as required by the administrator of your account. For
                        more information, see "Managed accounts and administrators" above.</p>


                    <p>Marketing information: If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain
                    information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last
                    expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using
                    your Channel Response Bot account. We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking
                        technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.</p>


                    <h3> How to access and control your information </h3>

                    <p>You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your information. Below is a summary of
                        those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations.</p>

                    <p>You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information</p>

                    <p>Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request
                    would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your
                    administrator are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep. Where you have
                    asked us to share data with third parties, for example, by installing third-party apps, you will
                    need to contact those third-party service providers directly to have your information deleted or
                    otherwise restricted. If you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data
                    protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights
                        were infringed.</p>


                    <p>Access and update your information: Our Services and related documentation give you the ability to
                    access and update certain information about you from within the Service. For example, you can access
                        and delete rule data using Slack's slash commands</p>


                    <p>Request that we stop using your information: In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing,
                    storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don't have the
                    appropriate rights to do so. For example, if you believe a Services account was created for you
                    without your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we delete your
                    account as provided in this policy. Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited
                    purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that
                    has already taken place at the time. You can also opt-out of our use of your information for
                    marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below. When you make such requests, we may need
                    time to investigate and facilitate your request. If there is delay or dispute as to whether we have
                    the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information
                    until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved, provided your administrator does not object
                    (where applicable). If you object to information about you being shared with a third-party app,
                        please disable the app or contact your administrator to do so.</p>


                    <p>Opt out of communications: You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using
                    the unsubscribe link within each email, updating your email preferences within your Service account
                    settings menu, or by contacting us as provided below to have your contact information removed from
                    our promotional email list or registration database. Even after you opt out from receiving
                    promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding
                        our Services. You can opt out of some notification messages in your account settings.</p>


                    <p>You may be able to opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from other companies who are
                    members of the Network Advertising Initiative or who subscribe to the Digital Advertising Alliance's
                    Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. For more information about this
                    practice and to understand your options, please visit: http://www.aboutads.info,
                        http://optout.networkadvertising.org/ and http://www.youronlinechoices.eu.</p>


                    <p>Turn off Cookie Controls: Relevant browser-based cookie controls are described in our Cookie Policy.</p>


                    <p>Send "Do Not Track" Signals: Some browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" (DNT) features that can
                    send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is
                    not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our Services do not currently
                    respond to browser DNT signals. You can use the range of other tools we provide to control data
                    collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving marketing from us as described
                        above.</p>


                    <p>Data portability: Data portability is the ability to obtain some of your information in a format you
                    can move from one service provider to another (for instance, when you transfer your mobile phone
                    number to another carrier). Depending on the context, this applies to some of your information, but
                    not to all of your information. Should you request it, we will provide you with an electronic file
                    of your basic account information and the information you create on the spaces you under your sole
                        control i.e. a workspace where you are the sole administrator.</p>


                    <h2>Other important privacy information</h2>


                    <h2>Notice to End Users</h2>

                    <p>Many of our products are intended for use by organizations. Where the Services are made available to
                    you through an organization (e.g. your employer), that organization is the administrator of the
                    Services and is responsible for the accounts and/or Service sites over which it has control. If this
                    is the case, please direct your data privacy questions to your administrator, as your use of the
                    Services is subject to that organization's policies. We are not responsible for the privacy or
                        security practices of an administrator's organization, which may be different than this policy.</p>


                    <p>Administrators may be able to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> require you to reset your account password;</li>
                        <li>restrict, suspend or terminate your access to the Services;</li>
                        <li>access information in and about your account;</li>
                        <li>access or retain information stored as part of your account;</li>
                        <li>install or uninstall third-party apps or other integrations</li>
                    </ul>


                    <p>In some cases, administrators can also:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>restrict, suspend or terminate your account access;</li>
                        <li>change the email address associated with your account;</li>
                        <li>change your information, including profile information;</li>
                        <li>restrict your ability to edit, restrict, modify or delete information</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Even if the Services are not currently administered to you by an organization, if you use an email
                    address provided by an organization (such as your work email address) to access the Services, then
                    the owner of the domain associated with your email address (e.g. your employer) may assert
                    administrative control over your account and use of the Services at a later date. You will be
                        notified if this happens.</p>


                    <p>If you do not want an administrator to be able to assert control over your account or use of the
                    Services, use your personal email address to register for or access the Services. If an
                    administrator has not already asserted control over your account or access to the Services, you can
                    update the email address associated with your account through your account settings in your profile.
                    Once an administrator asserts control over your account or use of the Services, you will no longer
                        be able to change the email address associated with your account without administrator approval.</p>


                    <p>Please contact your organization or refer to your administrator’s organizational policies for more
                        information.</p>


                    <h2>California Requirements</h2>


                    <p>Exercising your rights: If you are a California resident, there are some additional rights that may
                    be available to you under the California Consumer Protection Act ("CCPA"). This policy explains the
                    tools that we have made available to you to exercise your data rights under the CCPA, such as the
                    right to deletion and the right to request access to the categories of information we have collected
                    about you. For more information on how to exercise your rights please visit the "How to access and
                    control your information" section of this policy. We encourage you to manage your information, and
                    to make use of the privacy controls we have included in our Services. You will not be discriminated
                    against for exercising any of your privacy rights under the CCPA. In order to protect your
                    information from unauthorized access or deletion, we may require you to provide additional
                    information for verification. If we cannot verify your identity, we will not provide or delete your
                        information.</p>

                    <h2>International Data Transfers and Data Processing Addendum</h2>

                    <p>Effective September 2021</p>

                    <p>Channel Response Bot employs safeguards for cross-border transfers of personal data, as required by
                    applicable local law, including data security standards and Standard Contractual Clauses to the
                    extent that our processing of your data is subject to certain international laws, including but not
                    limited to European Data Protection Law, meaning Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and
                    of the Council on the protection of natural persons with regard to the Processing of Personal Data
                    and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation) (the "EU GDPR"); the
                    United Kingdom the Data Protection Act 2018 and the GDPR as saved into United Kingdom law by virtue
                    of Section 3 of the United Kingdom's European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the "UK GDPR"); the EU
                        e-Privacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC); and the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act ("Swiss DPA").</p>

                    <p>Privacy Shield: On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued a judgment
                    declaring as “invalid” the European Commission’s Decision (EU) 2016/1250 of 12 July 2016 on the
                    adequacy of the protection provided by the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. As a result of that decision, the
                    EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework is no longer a valid mechanism to comply with EU data protection
                    requirements when transferring personal data from the European Union to the United States. As
                    mentioned, and after this decision, Channel Response Bot already relies on the European Commission’s
                    Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) as its legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of
                        the EU, and the SCCs are included in our Data Processing Addendum.</p>


                    <p>Customers requiring a copy of our Data Processing Addendum can request one by contacting us at
                        ChannelResponseBot@gmail.com</p>
