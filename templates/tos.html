                    <ul>

                        <h2>7 - Governing Law</h2>
                        <p>Unless otherwise required by law – and which shall only be applied strictly for its intended
                            purpose, it is expressly agreed that US law shall be the law applicable to these Terms of
                            Use
                            and any litigation between you and GRBLDeveloped. related to the use of the Channel Response
                            Bot
                            Service shall be submitted to the jurisdiction of a competent court in Delaware.</p>

                        <p>These Terms of Service will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
                            State
                            of Delaware, without giving effect to its conflict of law provisions or your actual state or
                            country of residence. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any
                            provision or
                            portion of the Terms of Service to be unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms of Service
                            will
                            continue in full force and effect.</p>

                        <p>To support delivery of our services, Channel Response Bot may use data processors with access
                            to
                            certain customer data (referred to as subprocessor). For such purposes, we will provide
                            information about the identity, location, and role of each subprocessor.</p>

                        <h2>Third Party Subprocessors</h2>
                        <p>Channel Response bot uses several third-party subprocessors to provide infrastructure
                            services,
                            and payment processing. Prior to use of any third-party services, Channel Response Bot
                            conducts
                            a thorough evaluation of their privacy, security, and confidentiality practices before
                            implementing them.</p>
